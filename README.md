# Vegan and Gluten-free Food Options

# Where to Go Vegan in Istanbul?
Below is a rather simple list of vegan options. However, if you are cooking yourself just as I do, I’ll also provide some grocery store delivery apps, too. Nevermind the mumblecore below. You can directly skip to the list. 

Please be advised, though: I am not an affiliate of these places, and writing this just out of good will. If you find better places, feel free to send a request.

## **Where can I find** v**egan food in Istanbul?**

I was a strict vegetarian from the age of 5 through 28. I know how hard it can be if you are following a special diet—whether it be a gluten-free anti-auto-immune protocol, or pure vegan one. Even omnivores like myself have hardships in finding healthy, hygienic and nutritionally rich options when our age's global adage in cuisine reflects the most mediocre of premia.

However, you are lucky that, contrary to the advertorial nature of food porn aesthetics that portray the Istanbulite cuisine nothing but that of meat-dominated Upper Mesopotamia, that which passes as a well-versed cuisine in Istanbul is also an amalgamation of tastes that spring from Aegean, Mediterranean, Black Sea, Caucasus, Thracian, Greek, Armenian, Judeo-Spanish, Levantine and many other sets of what constitutes a true cuisine.

In our day, even döner shoppes offer vegetarian options. However, I think many would prefer a truly vegan kitchen, and if you are not cooking yourself, it might be an arduous procedure to attain a well-cooked meal unless you are staying at a nice hotel. I will just list a couple of vegan, vegetarian restaurants below, however, wherever you go, you can also ask for "merely vegan/ vegetarian" options, too—they might try their best, no worries.

## **Grocery/ Food Apps**

[**Fuudy**](https://fuudy.co/)**:** Rich in Vegan portfolio of restraurants, supermarkets and shops

[**Macrocenter:**](https://www.macrocenter.com.tr/) Rather highish end franchise by Migros Türkiye where you can buy variety of extra options when it comes to groceries—also, if you are an omnivore, their selection to your taste in any terms is quite alright. The app re-directs to Migros superapp in which you can choose Macroonline, it has English language version. 3 to 5 Star Migros markets are OK, too.

[**Getir**](https://getir.com/) and [**Yemeksepeti**](https://www.yemeksepeti.com/) are other options. You might need these according to your neighbourhood, however, they might not have all the options.

### Final Notes

Many local coffee shops and most of the time international ones, too, offer vegan, gluten-free snacks. My favorite ones are [Espresso Lab](https://en.espressolab.com/), [Juan Valdez](https://www.juanvaldezcoffee.com.tr/), and [People of Coffee](https://www.peopleofcoffee.com.tr/). Some Starbucks branches are, too, good, and have some of the best baristas. Café Nerro would be another option. You can asses the shoppe you set a foot in yourselves, too, and offer amendments to do list by sending a request via git.
